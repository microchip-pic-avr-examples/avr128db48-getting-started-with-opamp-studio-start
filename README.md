#  Getting Started with Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP)

The Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) peripheral features up to three internal operational amplifiers (op amps). The op amps can be configured to a multitude of different operations using internal multiplexers and resistor laders  

The main purpose of op amps is to condition the analog signals before acquisition in a microcontroller or to provide the necessary output drive in control applications

These examples show the following configurations of the OPAMP peripheral on the AVR DB family of microcontrollers:

* **Voltage Follower:** 
OP0 is configured as an voltage follower
* **Non-Inverting PGA:** 
OP0 is configured as a non-inverting PGA
* **Differential Amplifier:** 
OP0 and OP1 are combined to create a differential amplifier 
* **Instrumentation Amplifier:** 
OP0, OP1 and OP2 are combined to create an instrumentation amplifier
